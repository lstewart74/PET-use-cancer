				</div>
                <p class="style3">The PET PREDICT TRIAL on women with early stage breast cancer lead directly to motions in 2005 from CANM to declare the CCO PET Trials “unethical”. The Liberal government and their medical experts devoted special efforts to make sure that women with breast cancer and the appropriate indications for PET would not have access to one. To this day this “unethical, immoral” experiment is used to block these women from PET. This more than anything demonstrates the ‘depths’ to which the politicians and their medical experts are prepared to descend to block PET.</p>

                <p class="style3">All experiments on humans, and animals must go through a strict approval process by a board dedicated to this effort. The boards also have a critical responsibility to monitor the trial to ensure it continues to meet the highest ethical standards. The board members may not be familiar with the technology being assessed They may not have known that the PET cameras were incapable of detecting the cancers the subjects were told the researchers were looking for, but it is their responsibility to make sure it is capable of performing the imaging that is being tested.</p>

                <p class="style3">The NDP present themselves as the ‘party of the people’ but as you will see, have outright backed the Liberal’s efforts to block PET even when Howard Hampton was the leader. Most importantly, Sudbury Nickel Belt NDP MPP and NDP Health Critic knows more than any politician all of the ‘gory details’. France claims she wants to bring the dreams of a remarkable Sudbury native, Mr. Sam Bruno, who died of colon cancer to fruition. For those in Sudbury, you can decide for yourselves based on the facts whether or not France deserves the right to continue to represent those in her district or not. Ms. Horwath, above all, needs to be held accountable.</p>

                <p class="style3">Criminal charges were laid against Australian government officials for how they blocked PET. As Ontario physicians we are forced by Cancer Care Ontario to practice guidelines appropriate for the mid to late 1990’s. In my opinion, this forces us in a very real way to “assault our patients” both physically and emotionally. I hope I at least get a response to these serious accusations which I will pass on to everyone.

He has made clear that he does not need "science" to assess PET, just his 'BELIEF/FAITH' that his methods to evaluate imaging equipment has a role to play. He is now head of a group that will now determine how to provide "Quality" health care to Ontario patients, and "using rigorous scientific" methods. To suggest this is a 'misleading of the public' would be an understatement. I am challenging Dr. Laupacis to explain the discrepancy./p>

I have written Ms. Lsyk for two reasons. One is to give her the 'backstory' as to how the Liberal government and their medical 'experts' have used a politically driven agenda directed against patients, and not science, which has resulted in costly health care focused on the income expectations of some physicians.  I have also pointed out in detail how the appropriate introduction of PET would result in significant savings to taxpayers./p>

				</div>
                <p class="style3">The PET Steering Committee wrote the two versions of the PET PREDICT Trial on women with early-stage breast cancer. The trial was sponsored by OCOG. It was this trial that finally led to the Canadian Nuclear Medicine Community to pass the 2005 motions declaring the Ontario PET Trials from Cancer Care Ontario and their McMaster colleagues "unethical". The PET Steering Committee members are in effect public servants. Normally if physicians have questions about publications or the work of colleagues this is done in private. However, these physicians are truly Public Servants whose actions directly impact the health care of effectively all Ontario cancer patients. Therefore they have a clear duty to publicly defend their actions. To date, they have refused to defend the PET PREDICT Trial.

                       <p class="style3">I remind Dr. Hoskins how proud he and Ms. Wynne are of how CCO is handling PET. I sent this letter to Dr. Hoskins on behalf of two patients I was representing to PET ACCESS, and insist that he make sure the questions they have the right to ask and have answered are responded to and answered fully. Neither Dr. Hoskins nor PET ACCESS will acknowledge or respond to patients questions.</p>

 				</div>
                       <p class="style3">OCOG is a CCO committee that was set up in part to discredit, delay and block PET. OCOG would be the sponsor for the PET PREDICT Trial which lead to the motions declaring trials unethical. I had unsuccessfully tried to get OCOG to reply in the past. Note, Dr. Levin’s curious but ‘telling response’ of whether he is proud of the efforts of OCOG, or worried they might have to publicly defend their actions.

                        <p class="style3">Dr. Bill Evans was the first Chair, and Dr. Evans would eventually have me reprimanded by the College of Physicians and Surgeons because I asked him to defend the use of health technology assessment. I take the approach that Dr. Metser wasn’t present during the most controversial times and might take a new approach. You can decide for yourselves if he will.

                        <p class="style3">Dr. Dobranowski’s talk at medical meeting in 2009 lead to Dr. Al Driedger resigning from the PET Steering Committee and declaring the PET Trials “bordering on immoral”. I wrote Dr. Dobranowski asking him to defend the use of HTA and given they are all so proud, surely they would want the Ethics Review of what happened in Ontario to be carried out to justify their approach to PET.</p>

                        <p class="style3">I wrote Ms. Wynne taking the approach that I agreed with many of her concerns about how healthcare is delivered in Ontario and offered to work behind the scenes to confront some of the powerful physicians groups wanting the status quo. I also make her fully aware of the consequences of her potentially having to defend what the Liberals have done to women with breast cancer. She ignores me.</p>

Although required by Provincial Law to have someone from his office acknowledge my letter and send some sort of reply, he will refuse to do so. He was presented this letter by the NDP Health Critic, and I complained to the Attorney General who dismissed me, as well as the Ontario Ombudsman and finally Ms. Wynne before he responded. He will insult my professionalism and intelligence.</p>

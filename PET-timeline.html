				<p class="small">A multidisciplinary committee headed by Dr. Al Driedger and consisting of experts involved with treating and performing diagnostic imaging tests on cancer patients examines evidence for potential roles for PET for Ontario patients. There were five indications for PET in routine use. For lung cancer it was already the accepted world standard for management of these patients rather than conventional management with CT scans.

			<div class="col-sm-5">
            	<h4>Initial findings</h4>
				<p class="small">The committee presented their findings to the Ontario Ministry of Health (MOH) recommending established roles for: Cancer Patients, Neurology (Brain Imaging), and Cardiac Disease. They estimate that sufficient clinical evidence to warrant PET scans for approx. 40K Ontario patients/year. Minister of Health, Mr. Tony Clement, reviews report and decision is made that the government is unwilling to pay for PET services. Key <a href="#" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#cco">Cancer Care Ontario</a> (CCO) medical experts are told to do what is necessary to delay, discredit and block PET. Mr. Michael McCarthy, Senior Assistant to Mr. Clement was present at these meetings and later is hired by the Ontario Association of Nuclear Medicine as a lobbyist to challenge government’s methods of introducing PET in Ontario.

				<h4>Meeting with MOH</h4>
                <p class="small">MOH sets up meeting with the Multidisciplinary Team who are assuming the government would act on their recommendations for Ontario cancer patients, who would then have the same access to PET that was available elsewhere in the world. An MOH official present at the meeting shows a poster presentation from an Australian Medical Meeting claiming that PET had no beneficial effect on the management of lung cancer cases. This poster was tantamount to a conference abstract - non-peer reviewed and consisting of preliminary data at best.

				<h4>Ministry of Health PET Trials</h4>
				<p class="small">MOH begins work on its own PET trials. The PET Steering Committee (PSC) is set up by CCO . It's mandate is to determine potential roles for PET imaging and advise the MOH. Dr. Bill Evans, an oncologist from McMaster University is the Chair. In 2000, the government commissioned the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) at McMaster to review the scientific literature and make recommendations regarding the use of PET in cancer, cardiac disease, and neurologic disorders. ICES <a href="docs/HTA-PET-ICES-Full-article.pdf" target="_blank">releases a report in 2001</a> and concludes the number of high quality studies is distressingly small. They will determine the quality of PET evidence using Health Technology Assessment [HTA], also developed through McMaster. There is no empirical evidence that supports the use of HTA to evaulate PET or any other diagnostic imaging device.</p>

				<h4>Funding of PET Trials</h4>
                <p class="small">The proposed PET Trials will require approximately 1,700 patients. Four Million dollars is allotted to complete trials with the majority to the funding is set aside for data analysis using HTA after all scans were complete. Five Teaching Hospitals in Ontario were assigned to conduct the scans for PET Trials but only received enough funding to to perform 32 patient per camera per year. Thus, it would have taken more than 10 years just to complete the scans (when Susan Martinuk's report on the use of PET in Canada is published in 2011 the Ontario PET trials were still ongoing). Repeated letters and attempts by those having to perform the scans and from the Ontario Association of Nuclear Medicine (OANM) to increase funding are either ignored, or rejected.

					<h4>Accusations Surface</h4>
					<p class="small">Dr. Al Driedger, the most senior member of the PSC bypasses the Chair, Dr. Bill Evans, and writes directly to Mr. George Smitherman the Minister of Health for Mr. Dalton McGuinty, the Liberal Premiere. Dr. Driedger makes following very serious accusations:
the Minister is blocking PET because of cost concerns and the government’s expert medical advisors are deliberately blocking evidence favourable to PET. Several years later Dr. Rodney Hicks <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_jgREdFOPMiTnJuUjdfNlVPcHM/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">will publish a study</a> proving this to be true along with other methods used to manipulate and discredit PET. Driedger also points out that PET utilization in Ontario is already a decade behind the rest of the world.</p>

            	<h4>Smitherman, <em>et al</em>.</h4>
                <p class="small">Mr. Smitherman in turn refuses to even acknowledge or respond to Dr. Dreiger while Dr. Webster meets with Dr. Les Levin, the Senior Medical Advisor to the MOH, to discuss these same issues as well as argue the evidence supporting the use of HTA to evaluate PET. Surprisingly, Dr. Levin ridicules HTA as something you would find the back pages of less reputable journals - the same HTA that will be used to evaluate PET, with Levin's full support, despite having no credible scientific backing for this role. Dr. Levin is later promoted to Chief Scientific Officer at MaRS. Clinical trials begin. </p>

				<p class="small">PET trials developed by the PSC are done so in relative secrecy, and the prospect of collaboration with Canadian PET experts is rejected. <a href="docs/letters/PET-trial-questions-2.pdf" target="_blank">Questions and concerns emerge from the OANM</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.canm-acmn.ca/" target="_blank">Canadian Association of Nuclear Medicine</a> (CANM), for example, with the MOH's PET Breast Trial regarding violation of basic research ethics principles.

                <h4>Complaints to the Ombudsman</h4>
				<p class="small">A patient with breast cancer complained to the new Ombudsman, Mr. Andre Marin, http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/reevely-the-mess-of-andre-marin, about her lack of access to PET. I decided to give the Ombudsman’s Office another chance, and would work with Mr. Marin’s team on what he would eventually describe as the most complex investigation he had carried out to date.
<br/><br/>
I would send him all documents and background information that I had on the issues as well as put him contact with key Canadian experts in PET. Ironically the government would stonewall Mr Marin when his predecessor, Ms. Amaral, had dismissed the ‘stonewalling’ of my colleagues and me! In June of 2008, in his annual public statement, Mr. Marin noted how the government was not forthcoming on the issues related to PET. In December of 2008 a 32 page document of questions and concerns was submitted to the government with the request for a response by February 2009. In his June address Mr. Marin again points out the government’s refusal to respond to this document. 
<br/><br/>
In July 2009 the government announces that it will fund a very limited number of PET scans under OHIP. The response of Mr. Marin is to state that all his concerns and questions have been taken care of and he both closes the investigation and then buries the investigation from Public Access. So all of the issues and concerns in the 32 page submission are dismissed by the government allowing a couple of hundred PET scans/PET camera/year to be covered under OHIP! When I ask why Mr. Marin has buried the investigation from Public Access I am told that in his opinion, Mr. Marin did not think that making the investigation public would add anything further to the debate surrounding PET! He was off course fully aware of the 2005 motions by the Canadian Association of Nuclear Medicine declaring the trials as “unethical”, yet not only did he dismiss these concerns but would go on the Public Record and congratulate the government on their handling of PET in Ontario.</p>

			<div class="col-sm-5">
				<p class="small">In spite of being aware of all the issues involved in blocking PET for Ontario cancer patients from PET, the final realization that the Ombudsman’s Office was just another tool the government used against patients was truly shocking to me. I decided the issue was simply too big to tackle and gave up on trying for about two years. Then as I began to deal with more and more examples of patients who were ‘victims’ of this agenda driven assault of the government I decided to develop a website in the hopes this would be more effective in bringing attention the issues. I spent almost two years working with two different website developers and then following up once the website was up and running. After a year I shut it down since about the only people following the site were those from the government such as Dr. Julian Dobranowski who was Provincial Head of Imaging for Cancer Care Ontario.</p>

			<div class="col-sm-5 ">
				<p class="small">Also in the fall of 2009 there was a national meeting on PET in Oncology held in Toronto. Dr. Dobranowski spoke about how CCO would continue to investigate PET for patients. After he spoke, Dr. Al Driedger who was the most Senior Member of the PET Steering Committee went to microphone and said he had had enough. He resigned from the committee; said he regretted ever working with CCO; and that “what those blocking PET in Ontario were doing, bordered on immoral.” After Dr. Dobranowski left the stage I went up to him and asked him several questions. He was a bit ‘shaken’ by the reaction of the audience to Dr. Driedger’s statements, so for once he actually gave honest answers to my questions. He did acknowledge among other things that there was absolutely no scientific basis to justify the way they would evaluate the ‘scientific validity’ of the evidence on PET, but CCO would continue to do this. He also agreed that real purpose of their experiments was not to validate PET, but to use PET to try and validate their Health Technology Assessment tool!!</p>

				<h4>CANM Meeting</h4>
				<p class="small">In January 2014, the annual meeting of the Canadian Association of Nuclear Medicine was held in Montreal. <a href="docs/letters/_DR BENNETT FEB 2015.pdf" target="_blank">Dr. Carolyn Bennett</a>, who was a Federal Liberal MPP, was a keynote speaker. Her topic was the discrepancy of availability of PET in Ontario compared to the rest of Canada, particularly in the light of the Canada Health Act which was to guarantee equal access to health care in Canada. I spoke with her established contact with her. She was from same Toronto riding as Dr. Hoskins the Provincial Liberal and Minister of Health and she spoke to him and he asked me to write him regarding my concern. <a href="docs/letters/DR HOSKINS INTRODUCTION LETTER MAY 2015.pdf" target="_blank">I wrote him in May 2015</a>.<br/>
			  <br/>Like his predecessor, Mr George Smitherman, although required to have someone from his office acknowledge and respond to my letter, he refused to do so. I made multiple unsuccessful attempts to get him to respond, including through Ms France Gelinas, the NDP Health Critic, the Ombudsman’s office of Mr Dube, two Attorney Generals from Ontario.In July 2016 I wrote to Ms Kathleen Wynne and said I agreed with much of their criticism of the healthcare system designed more to focus on income expectations of physicians rather than what is best for patients, among other things. I told her I would like to work quietly behind the scenes to work towards <a href="docs/letters/wynne-jul-1-2016.pdf" target="_blank">resolving these issues</a>. She stated that she would pass my concerns on to Dr Hoskins.</p>

				<h4>Hoskins' Response</h4>
				<p class="small"><a href="docs/letters/DOCTOR HOSKINS REPLY.pdf" target="_blank">Dr. Hoskins finally responded to me</a>. He unwittingly gave me the document I needed to go pursue this matter further. He states how proud he and Ms Wynne are of CCO’s efforts on PET. He goes on to list the attributes a diagnostic test for patients should have in order to be funded. All “motherhood and apple pie” issues which actually does exist for PET/CT, but not for the compulsory CCO standards using CT to investigate patients. He then chastizes me for not being concerned about  radiation exposure to patients from what CCO claims is “unproven technology”! I was about to send him letters from patients who had gross overexposure to radiation from all but useless CT scans. These patients could be managed far more appropriately and a major reduction in radiation exposure with PET/CT compared to CT alone.<br/><br/>In June 2015 I approached Health Sciences North Senior Administration with the third business plan to bring Mobile PET/CT to Sudbury, since the Ministry had told them shut down the three previous attempts. They also told them to shut this plan down. In November,Dr. Hoskins and Mr Glenn Thibeault announce 1.6 million for operating costs for a permanent scanner in Sudbury , available April 2016, for when the “Sam Bruno PET Fund” had enough donations to fully fund the purchase of the scanner. This cheque wasn’t about the Sam Bruno Fund, but was to block the efforts to get Mobile PET/CT for seven Ontario communities including Sudbury. The public was not told none of this money could be used for Mobile PET access.</p>

                <p class="small">Throughout 2016 I had multiple <a href="articles-interviews.html">media articles</a> on issues related to PET and Mobile PET/CT.  I was concerning the Liberals enough at this point that Dr Hoskins and others were responding to me in the media as well. In the fall of 2016 there was an article, <a href="http://www.thesudburystar.com/2016/11/15/ministry-nixes-mobile-pet-scanne-for-sudbury" target="_blank">Hoskins Nixes Mobile PET for Sudbury</a>. Every reason offered not to allow Mobile were “alternative truths”, yet repeatedly Dr. Hoskins and the Ministry refused to supply documents to back their statements.<br/><br/>I contact Professor Rodney Hicks from Australia, an acknowledged world expert in PET whose efforts to expose the Australian governments efforts to block PET lead to criminal charges against Ministry Officials. He said to me: “Ontario has the most egregious and politically motivated agenda against PET in the world.”.</p>

I outline to PET ACCESS the new approach I will be taking, in particular since I don’t agree with how they assess PET, that they will answer the patients questions regarding how decisions will be made about her getting PET as well as her management in general. They will only allow PET/CT after her staging by CT and MR and her radical radiation therapy to her pelvis.

Their first report was the one that used the medical poster on a couple of pieces of bristol board to reduce the recommendations of 40,000 patients would benefit from PET, to ZERO patients would benefit. He is the only I would write who offers a defense for the use of health technology assessment [HTA]. <a href="docs/letters/2018/19_RESPONSE FROM LAUPACIS RE HTA.pdf" target="_blank">He doesn’t offer any scientific evidence to validate the HTA</a>, but like assessing PET by CCO was a religion, “HE BELIEVES” there is role for the HTA, and states how proud he is of his work. Dr. Michael Sherar proposes that <a href="docs/letters/2018/20_DR SHERAR MEETING PROPOSAL.pdf" target="_blank">I come to Toronto and meet with CCO</a>. This is my first response to his email. After thinking about it and noting, that no one from CCO has said to me that the threats against my hospital privileges were just a misunderstanding, <a href="docs/letters/2018/21_DECISION NOT TO MEET WITH CCO.pdf" target="_blank">so I decline to meet</a>.</p>
                <p class="small">In February <a href="docs/letters/2018/22_FIRST EMAIL TO PATIENT OMBUD OFFIC.pdf" target="_blank">I contact the Office of Ms. Christine Elliott</a>, Ontario’s first Patient Ombudsman. I meet with her at her office in April and she is accompanied by the Ombudsman Lawyer. After the meeting I was ‘hopeful’ since Ms. Elliott seemed quite shocked at what she was hearing. I would then send the “lawyer” every document I had relevant to the issues on PET in general, and about the patients I was presenting to Ms. Elliott for her to assess: <a href="docs/letters/2018/23_TO MS WASSERSTEIN LAWYER RE CAROL.pdf" target="_blank">letter 1</a>, <a href="docs/letters/2018/24_MS ELLIOTT UPDATE CAROL MAY 15.pdf" target="_blank">letter 2</a>, <a href="docs/letters/2018/25_UPDATEFOR MS ELLIOTT MAY 14.pdf" target="_blank">letter 3</a></p>
                <p class="small">However, it soon becomes apparent that Ms. Elliott has had a change of heart and I get no response to repeated emails, or when I do, just promises things will be dealt with. <a href="docs/letters/2018/26_SEPT MS ELLIOT NOT RESPONDING.pdf">In September I write Ms. Elliott</a>. Still no response, <a href="docs/letters/2018/27_MS ELLIOTT RE NOT RESPOND AND CAROL PASSES.pdf">and as I am drafting a second letter</a> I get news that Carol has died in the hospice. Carol’s nightmare in the Ontario public hospital system was entirely because her physicians were forced by CCO “Standards” to treat investigate her with “substandard” imaging methods. Ms Elliott will dismiss everything that happened to Carol as either representing “Excellent Care for All” or not covered in her mandate, and of no concern to her.</p>
                <p class="small">In September I receive a registered letter from the Registrar’s Office of my licensing body, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario saying they are initiating an investigation on my work in Sudbury and Thunder Bay. It is not clear whether this has been triggered by patient complaints, or my activism on PET. In December they make it clear. Cancer Care Ontario has complained about my efforts to get PET for patients. Although I will cover in detail on the news media’s efforts to protect the government from criticism on PET, I had approached Mr. Steve Paikin who is one of Canada’s top paid news anchors and hosts the TVO show, <a href="https://tvo.org/programs/the-agenda-with-steve-paikin" target="_blank">THE AGENDA</a>.</p>
                <p class="small">We are living in a time where there is a long overdue discussion about what some have called FAKE NEWS. I have dealt with the media for over 35 years and I have yet to meet a ‘professional journalist’ that I could trust or respect. News is “fake” but I think a better term is “AGENDA DRIVEN NEWS since this makes clear how the news will be fake. Mr. Paikin will interview Dr. Hoskins, Mr. Dube our Ombudsman and Ms. Christine Elliott the Patient Ombudsman. He is fully aware of each of their efforts to make victims of Ontario’s cancer patients. Yet as you will see, MR PAIKIN WILL NOT TOUCH THIS NEWS STORY.  I think the title of the show, THE AGENDA, is perfect. You can decide for yourselves.</p> 
                <p class="small">Mr. Stephen Skyvington made numerous contacts with the producers of the AGENDA to have me on the show and I was put in touch with Ms Hilary Clark their ‘Editorial Gatekeeper’ and Mr. Harrison Lowman, the Producer. Here are some communications: <a href="docs/letters/2018/28_PAIKINS RESEARCH STAFF PERSON.pdf" target="_blank">initial email</a>, <a href="docs/letters/2018/29_MY FIRST MAJOR COMMUNICATION WITH MS CLARK.pdf" target="_blank">first</a> and <a href="docs/letters/2018/30_SECOND DETAILS EMAIL TO CLARK.pdf" target="_blank">second</a> letter to Ms. Clark, and <a href="docs/letters/2018/31_SOME COMMUNICATIONS WITH MR LOWMAN FROM THE AGENDA.pdf">first letter to Mr. Lowman</a>. Mr Lowman <a href="docs/letters/2018/32_LETTER FROM MINISTRY TO AGENDA.pdf" target="_blank">later contacts me</a> saying he sent the MOH a series of questions, and asked me to comment on their response. Here are the MOH responses. In particular note the blatant ‘alternative truth’ about me being the only one to criticize the MOH since 2010. The major condemning TRIUMF article about how Ontario handled PET was published in 2011.</p>
                <p class="small">This is <a href="docs/letters/2018/33_MY RESPONSE TO CCO LETTER TO AGENDA.pdf" target="_blank">commentary</a> on the letter from the MOH. It eventually becomes clear they will not touch these issues, so this is my <a href="docs/letters/2018/34_THE AGENDA WON'T TOUCH STORY.pdf" target="_blank">final letter to The Agenda team</a>. Keep in mind that Ontario taxpayers are paying Mr. Paikin’s and THE AGENDA Team’s salaries so that they can do what we all know “our professional journalists and news anchors’ do, They are there to shield the government from criticism. It is because of this reason that I am making a special effort to try and make PET a key election issue, IN SPITE OF THE BEST EFFORTS OF PEOPLE LIKE PAIKIN and the rest of “our most trusted sources of news and information.”</p>

				<h4>Ontario Auditor General's 2017 Report on Cancer Treatment Services</h4>
                <p class="small">The report comments that Ontario provides fewer PET scans/1,000 population than elsewhere in Canada and other countries. I suspect that they are unaware of why, or more importantly how the government deliberately and methodically achieved this position, using a scientifically baseless and politically agenda driven process. She is about to know how this was achieved. Although every time I have approached one of the “watchdogs” of our so called open transparent and accountable democracy I have found that they are part of the problem. I hope this time it will be different. If so, it could finally lead to perhaps finally carrying out the 2005 motion to have experts in Ethics and Health Policy determine how this could have happened in Ontario and finally proper access of PET/CT to Ontario’s patients.</p>

                    <p class="small">Cancer Care Ontario serves as a provincial agency tasked with the planning, coordination, and improvement of cancer care services across the province. Among their many strategic goals and priorities they claim to facilitate timely access to high quality cancer imaging services and diagnotics, such as PET.</p>

                <h4 class="text-ccc">Who is the Ombudsman?</h4>
                <p>The Ombudsman of Ontario is an Officer of the Provincial Legislature who is independent of government and political parties. The Ombudsman’s job is to ensure government accountability through effective oversight of the administration of government services. The Ombudsman is appointed for a five-year renewable term and his powers and authorities are contained in legislation under the Ombudsman Act.</p>
                <h4 class="text-ccc ">Complaints registered with current ombudsman</h4>
                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sFNDeOhM_E&t=134s" target="_blank">Ontario Ombudsman - Liberal watchdog or lapdog?</a></p>
                <p>Dr. Webster registered a complaint with Ms. Amaral regarding the fact that all of the Ministry of Health officials he and his colleagues had contacted regarding PET issues had refused to acknowledge or respond to the issues raised. In 2004 the Senior PET STEERING Committee member wrote the Minister of Health, Mr. George Smitherman pointing out among things that the government’s experts were deliberately blocking evidence that favoured PET. Although required by provincial law to have someone acknowledge and respond to this correspondence, he would repeatedly refuse to do so.<br/><br/>Under Ms Amaral’s direction I resubmitted these questions to the various individuals including asking Mr. Smitherman to explain why he didn’t respond to Dr. Driedger, and asked him to finally respond to the questions. In his response, Mr. Smitherman did not answer a single question of relevance. Ms. Amaral’s conclusions were that all of our questions had been addressed and she closed the file. I responding by pointing out no questions had been answered, but she must have the answers and would she share them with us. Her response was that due to “privacy of information” issues she could not share those answers with us!</p>
                
              <p>The former Ontario Ombudsman investigated the process by which the Ministry of Health evaluated PET. <a href="http://ottawacitizen.com/news/politics/reevely-the-mess-of-andre-marin" target="_blank">Andr&eacute; Marin</a>, a lawyer, served two terms as Ontario Ombudsman from 2005 to 2015. Mr. Marin oversaw two investigations into how the Ministry of Health (MOH) and physicians evaluated the scientific and medical evidence regarding PET and cancer management, which the Ontario government then used to determine which, if any indications they will fund via OHIP.</p>
                <p class="small"><a href="docs/complaint-ombudsman.pdf" target="_blank">Letter to Mr. Dub&eacute;</a>, re: complaints against Andr&eacute; Marin</p>
                <p>When a letter is sent to a government official, such as Minister of Health Dr. Eric Hoskins, Provincial Law states that they, or a representative of their office must record and file the letter as well as send a response. Last spring (2015), Dr. Hoskins had requested a summary and outline of concerns regarding PET but has yet to offer any response. The Attorney General (AG) ensures those in Public Office follow the rules and regulations set forth by the province and would be in a position to determine why Dr. Hoskins had deviated from Provincial Law.</p>
